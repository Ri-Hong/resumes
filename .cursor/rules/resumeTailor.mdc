description: "Rules for tailoring LaTeX resumes to specific job descriptions"
alwaysApply: true

# 🎯 Purpose

This repository contains a **master LaTeX resume** (`master.tex`) with all experiences and projects.  
Your task is to **automatically tailor resumes** for specific job applications by selecting and reordering content from the master resume.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `master.tex` - **Master resume** containing ALL experiences, projects, and skills (the single source of truth)
- `resume_name.txt` - **Global resume name** (in root directory, optional, defaults to "resume")
  - Contains a single line with the resume name (e.g., "Ri_Hong" or "resume")
  - Used for all generated resume files across all jobs
- `applications/` - Directory containing job-specific resumes
  - Each job has its own nested subdirectory: `applications/{company}/{role}/{version}/`
  - Contains:
    - `{resume_name}.tex` (tailored resume LaTeX file)
    - `{resume_name}.pdf` (compiled PDF, if generated)
    - `job_description.txt` (original job posting)
  - Version numbering: starts at `1` for new roles, increments for multiple resumes per role

---

## 🧠 Core Objectives

### 1. Reference the Master Resume

- **ALWAYS** read `master.tex` as the source of truth for all available experiences and projects.
- **NEVER** add experiences, projects, or skills that don't exist in `master.tex`.
- You can only **select, reorder, reword, or remove** content from the master.

### 2. Analyze the job description

- **Automatically extract** the **company name** and **role title** from the job description.
  - If company or role cannot be clearly inferred, **ASK the user** to provide them explicitly.
- Extract **key skills/technologies** and **primary focus areas** (e.g., backend, ML, systems, frontend, infra).
- Create sanitized directory names:
  - Company: lowercase, hyphens for spaces/special chars (e.g., "Meta" → "meta", "Google Cloud" → "google-cloud")
  - Role: lowercase, hyphens for spaces/special chars (e.g., "Software Engineer" → "software-engineer")
- **Determine version number**:
  - Check if `applications/{company}/{role}/` directory exists
  - If it doesn't exist, use version `1`
  - If it exists, find the highest existing version number `n` and use version `n + 1`
  - Create directory structure: `applications/{company}/{role}/{version}/`
- **Determine resume file name**:
  - Check if user specified a custom resume name in their request (e.g., "name it Ri_Hong" or "save as John_Doe")
  - If specified, sanitize the name (replace spaces with underscores, remove special chars, keep alphanumeric and underscores/hyphens)
  - If not specified, check if `resume_name.txt` exists in the root directory and read the name from there
  - If neither exists, default to "resume"
  - Save the resume name to `resume_name.txt` in the root directory (global setting for all resumes)
- **Save the EXACT job description text** (verbatim, unmodified) to `applications/{company}/{role}/{version}/job_description.txt`.
  - **CRITICAL**: Do NOT summarize, edit, or modify the job description text in any way.
  - Save it exactly as the user provided it, preserving all formatting, line breaks, and content.
- Compare job requirements to content available in `master.tex`.

### 3. Select and adapt content

- **Select** the most relevant experiences and projects from `master.tex`.
- **Prioritize ruthlessly**: Only include the 3-4 most relevant work experiences and 2-3 most relevant projects.
- **Reorder** sections so the most relevant appear first.
- **Reword** bullet points to highlight relevant skills, metrics, and impact using job description keywords.
- **Limit bullet points**: Maximum 2-3 bullets per experience, 1-2 bullets per project to ensure one-page fit.
- **Condense aggressively**: Merge multiple achievements into single bullets, use concise language, remove filler words.
- **Remove** less relevant content entirely if needed to fit one page - it's better to have fewer, highly relevant items than to exceed one page.
- Never add experiences that do not exist — only **select, reword, or rearrange** from master.

### 4. Maintain structure and LaTeX integrity

- Follow existing LaTeX macros strictly.
- Do not break, rename, or redefine LaTeX commands or environments.
- Preserve the header, education, and contact format.
- Preserve macro usage such as `\resumeSubheading`, `\resumeItemListStart`, `\resumeItemListEnd`, and `\resumeItem`.

### 5. Keep it concise and one page - **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**

- **MANDATORY**: The final output MUST compile into **exactly one page** on US Letter paper (8.5" × 11"). This is non-negotiable.
- **If content exceeds one page, you MUST**:
  1. **Aggressively reduce bullet points**: Limit to 2-3 bullets per experience, 1-2 bullets per project
  2. **Merge and condense**: Combine related achievements into single bullets using semicolons or commas
  3. **Remove less relevant content**: Prioritize ruthlessly - remove entire experiences/projects if they're not highly relevant
  4. **Shorten descriptions**: Use concise language, remove filler words, use abbreviations where appropriate
  5. **Reduce spacing**: Minimize vertical spacing between sections (but maintain readability)
  6. **Limit experiences**: Include only the 3-4 most relevant work experiences
  7. **Limit projects**: Include only the 2-3 most relevant projects
  8. **Condense education**: Keep education section minimal (just degree, school, dates, GPA if high)
- **Before finalizing**: Estimate content length - if it appears it will exceed one page, proactively remove or condense content.
- **If too short**: Include more relevant experiences/projects from master (without fabricating content), but still ensure it fits on one page.

### 6. Output constraints

- **Source file**: `master.tex` (read-only reference)
- **Target files**:
  - `applications/{company}/{role}/{version}/{resume_name}.tex` (the tailored resume for this job)
    - Resume name is determined from user request, root `resume_name.txt` file, or defaults to "resume"
    - Sanitize resume name: replace spaces with underscores, remove special chars (keep alphanumeric, underscores, hyphens)
  - `applications/{company}/{role}/{version}/job_description.txt` (the EXACT, unmodified job posting text as provided by the user)
    - **MUST be saved verbatim** - no summarization, no editing, no modification whatsoever
  - `resume_name.txt` (in root directory, optional: stores the global resume name)
    - Contains a single line with the resume name (e.g., "Ri_Hong" or "resume")
    - Used for all generated resume files across all jobs
    - If user specifies a new name, update this global file
- Ensure LaTeX compiles cleanly (balanced environments, no missing braces, no unmatched lists).
- **Automatically create** the full directory structure (`applications/{company}/{role}/{version}/`) if it doesn't exist.
- **Version management**: Always check for existing versions and increment appropriately to allow multiple resumes per role.
- **Resume naming**: All generated files (`.tex`, `.pdf`) use the same base name as specified in `resume_name.txt` or user request.

## 🧩 Workflow

1. **User provides job description** (paste the full job posting text).  
   Optionally, user can specify a custom resume name (e.g., "name it Ri_Hong" or "save as John_Doe").

   Example:

```
Software Engineering Intern at Meta
We're looking for someone with experience in distributed systems,
reliability engineering, Python, and Kubernetes...
[full job description]

Please name this resume Ri_Hong
```

Or:

```
[Job description]

Create a resume for this, save it as John_Doe
```

2. **Automatically extract and create**:

   - Extract **company name** and **role title** from the job description
     - If unclear, **ask the user** to provide company and role explicitly
   - Sanitize names: lowercase, hyphens for spaces (e.g., "Meta" → "meta", "Software Engineer" → "software-engineer")
   - Check for existing versions in `applications/{company}/{role}/`
     - If no directory exists, use version `1`
     - If directory exists, find highest version `n` and use version `n + 1`
   - Create directory structure: `applications/{company}/{role}/{version}/`
   - **Determine resume name**:
     - Check if user specified a custom name in their request
     - If specified, sanitize it (spaces → underscores, remove special chars) and save to root `resume_name.txt`
     - If not specified, check root `resume_name.txt` file
     - If neither exists, default to "resume"
     - The resume name is global and applies to all generated resumes
   - **Save the EXACT job description text** (verbatim, unmodified) to `applications/{company}/{role}/{version}/job_description.txt`
     - Preserve all text exactly as the user provided it - do NOT summarize or edit

3. **Read master.tex** to understand all available experiences and projects.

4. **Tailor the resume**:

   - Select most relevant experiences/projects from `master.tex` (limit to 3-4 experiences, 2-3 projects)
   - Emphasize relevant skills and technologies from the job description
   - Use wording that reflects job description keywords
   - Move the most relevant experiences and projects to the top
   - **Limit bullet points**: Maximum 2-3 per experience, 1-2 per project
   - **Condense aggressively**: Merge achievements, use concise language, remove filler
   - Keep education, awards, and contact sections minimal and concise
   - **CRITICAL**: Ensure the final resume fits on exactly one page - remove content if necessary

5. **Save files**:
   - Save tailored resume to `applications/{company}/{role}/{version}/{resume_name}.tex`
     - Use the resume name from root `resume_name.txt` or user request (default: "resume")
   - If user specified a new resume name, save it to root `resume_name.txt` (global setting)
   - **Save the EXACT job description text** (verbatim, unmodified) to `applications/{company}/{role}/{version}/job_description.txt`
     - The job description file must contain the exact text the user pasted, with no summarization or modification

## ✅ Example Behavior

**Input:**

> Job: Backend Engineer Intern at AWS  
> Focus: Go, Kubernetes, Terraform, Cloud Infrastructure

**Expected Process:**

1. Extract: Company="AWS", Role="Backend Engineer Intern" → Sanitized: `aws` / `backend-engineer-intern`
2. Check for existing versions in `applications/aws/backend-engineer-intern/`
   - If none exist, use version `1` → Directory: `applications/aws/backend-engineer-intern/1/`
   - If `1` exists, use version `2` → Directory: `applications/aws/backend-engineer-intern/2/`
3. Determine resume name (from user request, root `resume_name.txt`, or default to "resume")
   - If user specified a new name, save it to root `resume_name.txt` (global setting)
4. Save the EXACT job description text (verbatim, unmodified) to `applications/aws/backend-engineer-intern/{version}/job_description.txt`
5. Read `master.tex` to see all available experiences (Groq, Base Power, Walnote.ai, etc.)
6. Select most relevant: Base Power (Go, Kubernetes, Temporal), Groq (Kubernetes, Terraform, GCP), HomeLab (Kubernetes, Terraform)
7. Reorder to put cloud/infrastructure experiences first
8. Reword bullets to emphasize "Go", "Terraform", "Kubernetes" where factually accurate
9. **Aggressively condense**: Limit to 2-3 bullets per experience, merge achievements, remove less relevant items entirely
10. **Verify one-page fit**: Ensure content fits on exactly one page - merge achievements, remove less relevant items entirely if necessary to fit the 1 page limit
11. Save tailored resume to `applications/aws/backend-engineer-intern/{version}/{resume_name}.tex`

## ⚙️ Implementation Notes

- The AI acts as a **resume-tailoring assistant**.
- The result should read naturally, emphasizing **action verbs, quantifiable results, and relevant technologies**.
- Do not use placeholders like "X" or "Y".
- Do not fabricate new roles, companies, or achievements.
- Always preserve factual accuracy and a professional tone.
- **CRITICAL**: When saving `job_description.txt`, save the EXACT text the user provided. Do NOT summarize, edit, or modify it in any way. The file should be a verbatim copy of what the user pasted.
- **CRITICAL - ONE PAGE REQUIREMENT**: The resume MUST fit on exactly one page. If content is too long:
  - Remove entire experiences/projects that are less relevant
  - Limit to 2-3 bullets per experience, 1-2 per project
  - Merge multiple achievements into single bullets
  - Use extremely concise language
  - Remove all non-essential information
  - It is better to have fewer, highly relevant items than to exceed one page
- **Resume naming**:
  - Users can specify a custom resume name in their request (e.g., "name it Ri_Hong", "save as John_Doe")
  - The resume name is sanitized (spaces → underscores, special chars removed)
  - Saved to `resume_name.txt` in the **root directory** (global setting for all resumes)
  - All generated files (`.tex`, `.pdf`) across all applications use this name as the base filename
  - If not specified, checks root `resume_name.txt`, otherwise defaults to "resume"
  - Users can manually edit root `resume_name.txt` to change the name globally
